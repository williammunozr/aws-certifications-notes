# Amazon EMR

## What is Amazon EMR?

Managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks.

- `Master Node`: A node that manages the cluster by running software components to coordinate the distribution of data and tasks among other nodes.
- `Core Node`: A node with software components that run tasks and store data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on your cluster. Multi-node clusters have at least one core node.
- `Taks Node`: A node with software components that only runs tasks and does not store data in HDFS task nodes are optional.
