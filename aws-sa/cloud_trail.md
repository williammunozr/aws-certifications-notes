# CloudTrail Essentials

- Logs API calls/activities as a `CloudTrail Event`.
- 90 days stored by default in `Event History`.
- Enabled `by default` - no cost for 90 day history.
- To customize the service, create 1 or more `Trails`.
- `Management` Events and `Data` Events.
- `Data Events` are disabled by default.
- `CloudTrail` is a `Regional Service`. But, there are two options: `One Region` Trail and `All Regions` Trail.
- `Not Realtime`, there is a delay.
